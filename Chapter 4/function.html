      function printAge() {
        console.log(age);
      }

      printAge(); // Output: 6

      //   The variable age is declared in the global scope.
      // The function printAge() is also declared in the global scope.
      // When console.log(age) runs inside printAge(), JavaScript looks for a variable named age:
      // First, it checks inside the function’s local scope (no match).
      // Then, it looks in the outer (global) scope and finds age = 6.
      // This behavior is called lexical scoping — functions in JavaScript can access variables that were defined in their outer (enclosing) scopes.
      //   Even though age is outside the function, it’s still visible to it because of how JavaScript scope chaining works.
